				When I reflect on my life, it's incredible to think about how fortunate I've
				been to make it into tech. While I'm financially very stable today, my family
				was never super well off growing up. We stayed with family when we weren't
				living in low income communities, were often in debt, and relied on our food
				stamps. So how did I get here?

				Early on, it was clear that education was never going to be my forte. Due
				to several psychiatric episodes and other stressors, I dropped out of high
				school, after being diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder (schizophrenia
				and bipolar disorder combined).<span class={styles.halfFaceContainer}>

				I worked a series of minimum-wage tech jobs until a storm of events, including
				my father's dual-organ transplant, jeopardized my ability to care for myself;
				much less my family. Right as everything was looking down I got my first
				major, six-figure software gig.<span

				I didn't do it alone; I owe a lot of my career to my friends and my many

				I made "The Framework Field Guide" free; I want to contribute back to
				the community that helped elevate me to where I am today.

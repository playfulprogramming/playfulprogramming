I know Angular, and the book is written in such a beautiful way I loved reading it. I just don't believe it is going to be available for free. It is one of the best technical books I've read recently; it's very well structured to give you ideas about React, Angular, and Vue.

Even if you are not interested in learning other frameworks and want to learn one, this book is still for you, this book is for everyone who wants to understand the concepts, and you can take those concepts to any other JS/TS frameworks which exist.

I am really impressed with "The Framework Field Guide" by Corbin - not only does it manage to describe various concepts of popular frameworks in a very concise way with code examples and illustrations, but it does so for multiple frameworks at once. For developers like me who are already familiar with React, it's a great way to learn how to translate those concepts to other frameworks. I highly recommend it.

As a developer, my main focus is on Python. I still find the world of JavaScript confusing at times. However, Corbin's teaching style is so easy-going that even people like myself can have a great time. I first met Corbin through one of his live streams, and I can assure you that his content is worth your while. If you need help with React, Angular, and/or Vue, you've come to the right place.

The structure of the book as a whole is well-organized and in-depth, making it a great resource for individuals with little to no prior experience in web development as well as those interested in learning more about the theoretical underpinnings of JavaScript frameworks.

In particular, what I like about Corbin's approach is how he takes intricate concepts and simplifies them down into easy to understand bits with clear, straightforward examples, all using a conversational tone.

Most old timey developers will tell you that, under the hood, nearly all programming languages work more or less the same. But Corbin is one of the first to lift that hood, climb in the engine bay & invite the world in for a tour. A book series that truly embodies the three E’s: Entertainment, engagement & education. Recommended for anyone with an interest in this whole ‘JavaScript frameworks’ razzledazzle.

Teaching three frameworks at once is a huge undertaking, but Corbin goes deeper into software than anyone I know. He identifies core concepts and teaches them in a way that's valuable for conceptual understanding, then shows practical implementations across frameworks. This is the most comprehensive guide I've seen!

This is one of the most unique and valuable approaches to teaching and learning frontend frameworks that I've ever seen. Being able to compare Angular, React, and Vue alongside each other while learning the core concepts of frameworks is incredible. I think focusing on the concepts while also showing how the different frameworks implement those concepts is an incredible idea!

The Framework Field Guide does a wonderful job of comparing and contrasting three of the most widely used UI frameworks out there. As a proficient user only in React, I found it quite useful for branching into Angular and Vue. I'd recommend this for anybody looking to level up their knowledge of modern UI frameworks!

Being a junior developer myself, the things Corbin can do with an IDE might as well be wizardry. He's the kind of guy that, when I asked him for help wrangling some code, instead built me a bespoke tool that did the job better than I could have imagined. Not to show off but just for the love of the craft. The kind of guy I wish I could have learned from in college.

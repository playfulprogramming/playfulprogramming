On Tuesday, we demonstrated how to set up a React environment and start a dev server. For this homework, you will set up a new React project and write a "Hello world" page that you can open in your browser.

Follow the [Web Framework Quickstart Guide](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/web-framework-quickstart-guide/) instructions under the "React" tab.

1. [Download and install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm create vite@latest` in your terminal
3. Answer the prompts to create a React + JavaScript project
4. Run `npm run dev` in your terminal
5. When the dev server starts up, type the "Local" address into your browser

If you've followed all of these steps correctly, you should be able to see the Vite + React demo in your browser.

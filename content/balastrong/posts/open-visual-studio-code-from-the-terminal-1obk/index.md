Ok, it's not a super secret feature, but I noticed some of my colleagues and friends do not use it at all while I think it's quite handy, so I'm sharing it here.

You might already know, but you can launch vscode from the terminal by just typing `code`

`code .` will Open vscode on the current location, also cool if you're wandering around your filesystem in the terminal for whatever reason.

It can also accept a parameter that is the path, so with `code your/path` it will open a vscode instance already pointing to that file or folder. This is particularly handy right after `git clone` as all you have to do is `code repo-name` and you're ready to write some code.

Last but for sure not least, I made a short video as usual about the topic, you can find it here:

**So, a question for you, how often do you open vscode from the terminal?**

**Do you want to add a new feature on Visual Studio Code, or fix an existing bug? Here’s how to do that!**

Let's see together how to move the first steps on the GitHub Open Source repository of **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** ([vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)) with the goal of submitting a Pull Request with our code! (*and getting featured in the next official release notes*).

Since the Open Source community is constantly growing, I recorded a video to help newcomers move the first steps. It will provide an overview on:

- Understanding the docs (You better not skip this part)
- Setting up the project
- Build & run
- Automated Testing (Spoiler: coverage is low)
- Using the debugger
- Finding an issue
- Contributing without code

Visual Studio Code is one of those large repositories that at first might seem impossible to understand, but the satisfaction in seeing a feature YOU developed, being used by thousands of developers every day, is huge.

This time I don't have a full written version for the article as most of the time I will screen share and directly show what I'm talking about, so here it is:

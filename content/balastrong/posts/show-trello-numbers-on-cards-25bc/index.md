**TL;DR**: The video was originally posted on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/G-nZXr_Gs6o), for a higher-quality version you can [watch it there](https://youtu.be/G-nZXr_Gs6o).

Add unique Trello card numbers to easily communicate with your team and write ids in commit messages.

Get the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-card-numbers-plus/ncibjlmfhjcjnphnpphgphbflpdpliei

The software is Open Source if you want to contribute! You can find here the repo: https://github.com/Balastrong/trello-card-numbers-plus

**BONUS**: Since the video, the OS project moved forward and now you can select a different color for the numbers :D

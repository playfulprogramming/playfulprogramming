I have wanted to write about tech conferences for a while, and last week I was at Codemotion in Milan. Perfect excuse to finally do it.

If you follow me here you know I usually share tutorials and technical content, but there is another huge part of our craft that I discovered only a few years ago: conferences. They open new opportunities and new ways of thinking that you will miss if you only focus on the tech. That would be a shame.

While I am still wearing the conference badge, here is why I think you should go to large tech events, what to expect, the pros, and yes, the cons.

### Watch the video

This article is actually an edited version of me rambling for ten minutes, you can watch it here:

## Meet people

The biggest advantage is simple: meet people. It may sound weird at a technical conference with folks on stage talking about code, but the highest value often comes from the hallway track.

Even as an attendee in the audience you get to meet a lot of amazing people. At Codemotion this year there were roughly 3000 attendees in the same venue, so there is plenty of room to find interesting conversations. As developers we might not love chit chat, but conversations at conferences are nothing like daily standups or status meetings. It is a different vibe, and among thousands of people you will surely find someone you click with.

These events are also designed to help you connect, not only to listen or deliver great talks. One thing I love at Codemotion is the Tech Expert booths: tables with experts on specific topics. You walk up, start from a shared interest like React or machine learning, others join, and it quickly becomes a small group discussion. It is a great way to meet new people.

I usually go with friends I met at work or at other events, but even if you go alone you will find many ways to make new ones. In large conferences you will keep seeing the same faces across editions and your relationships get stronger. You never know how much value can come from those interactions.

Talking to people lets you see the world from different points of view. We all live in a company bubble, which is fine and inevitable, but hearing from other developers, PMs, and folks in the industry broadens your perspective. It helps shape your opinions. The more you know, the better.

## Hard skills? Curiosity!

On paper the selling point of conferences should be the technical content. You go for the schedule of interesting talks. Sure, you can pick up hard skills from a session with an expert on stage, but for most talks the biggest takeaway is not learning a new syntax on the spot.

It is about getting inspired. A 30 to 40 minute session is not a course or a masterclass. You are not expected to walk out with deep understanding. Instead, you leave with a spark. You hear the right keywords, see a demo, and your curiosity switches on. Then when you get home you open your laptop and try it yourself. That is where the real learning happens. The talk gives you pointers and context so your research is faster and more focused.

## Keynotes

Large events also bring in great keynotes. On day two at Codemotion we had Scott Chacon, co-founder of GitHub, on stage talking about the why behind things. Hearing stories from people who actually built something meaningful is a huge source of inspiration. You get a glimpse into their thought process and collect advice you can apply to your own career.

And the coolest part is that it is not a YouTube video. The person is there, in the same venue. If you are lucky you can even meet them, shake hands, and have a quick chat. In the era of AI generated content, real life human interactions keep gaining value.

## Many parallel tracks

Not everything is perfect. The thing I like the least about large conferences is when there are too many parallel tracks. It is intentional and inevitable, but when there are six or seven tracks at the same time it gets hard to choose.

It is a happy problem to have many great options, but sometimes there are three talks you want to attend in the same slot and you can only pick one. Recordings help, but let's be honest: the magic is being there live. I do watch recorded talks, especially from events I could not attend, but for the ones I skip on site I rarely catch up later. You should, though. If recordings are available, watch them to fill the gaps.

## Large crowd

Crowds can be a downside too. Venues are usually huge, so if the area near the stages is packed you can step outside and breathe. There is almost always space.

The tricky part is meeting someone specific. With so many people you will need to text and coordinate. It happened this year that I wanted to meet a couple of folks and never bumped into them. A simple tip: post on LinkedIn or your socials that you will be at the conference so friends and connections can plan to meet you at a specific spot.

## Tickets and travel

Travel time and ticket costs are real tradeoffs. Big events tend to be pricey, but if you know you are going keep an eye on early bird tickets. They are usually much cheaper. The same applies to travel and accommodation: planning ahead saves money.

## Should you go?

Wrapping up: large tech conferences get a big yes from me. You know the pros and the cons. Go there, learn, network, and most importantly have fun. We are there to meet people, grow, and enjoy the experience.

This one was about large events like Codemotion Milan. The world of tech events also includes medium and small conferences. I attended a couple of those this month, and one where I was a speaker, so I might write about them next. Stay tuned!

Green squares on GitHub aren't just a mere activity indicator. Move a step back and look at the bigger picture: they tell a story, your story.

This post will be slightly different from the usual as it's not technical but rather more... personal.

I saw on Twitter that everyone was sharing their GitHub contribution chart on one image with a simple tool, probably because it was shared by the [official GitHub account](https://twitter.com/github/status/1609112210361516032) and retweeted by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1609597390201454595).

Funnily enough, this tool isn't new but it's been there since 2018 and you can find it at https://github-contributions.vercel.app/

So... why not, I decided to give it a try and I generated my contribution chart, from 2014 when I created my GitHub account to today, 2023.

Even if I don’t have a long and intense career (yet) I immediately realized that those green squares, how they’re grouped and positioned, meant a lot to me. They were depicting my career so far in an image.

I took some time to look at the picture and a lot of great memories came to my mind, so I decided to switch on my webcam and record my thoughts, I hope somehow in an inspiring way.

In the above image I can see some milestones such as:

- My time at the university
- The game development experience
- Quitting my job to find the amazing company I work for today
- The accepted Pull Requests on vscode
- ... and many more!

If you're curious, the outcome is as uploaded on my YouTube channel where I usually talk about Open Source, so here's the video:

Let me also invite you to try out the tool and take a moment to look at your own chart. I’m sure it will tell a lot about you, so many great memories lie among those green squares. Feel free to write in a comment what a particular square or cluster means to you.

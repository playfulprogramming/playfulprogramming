When I'm writing this I'm still on the train back from [ReactJSDay](https://www.reactjsday.it/), the largest conference on ReactJS in Italy, reflecting on something that happened from the audience.

I gave my talk about TanStack Start, showcasing why I like this full stack framework and how it is powered by TanStack Router, my favourite routing library as of today.

At the end of the session I got a question about how much effort would it take to migrate a very large React Router codebase to TanStack Router. My answer has been honest: I’ve been lucky enough to always start fresh with TanStack Router or only migrate smaller project so I didn’t have a direct experience to share. By the book it is indeed doable (and there’s a migration guide in the docs), but that was it from my side.

However, during lunch there was a board where attendees could reserve a spot for a lightning talk and to my surprise I’ve seen a proposal about "how we migrated a huge codebase from React Router to TanStack Router".

The attendee showed up on stage, opening up with "I heard the question from this morning talk, we did that migration on my team and I wanted to share how it went" and I absolutely loved it!

My talk was relatively easy, I had my slides, all demos prepared on vscode (thanks Elio for [Demo Time](https://demotime.show/), such an amazing tool for speakers) but showing up with a spontaneous and unprepared lighting talk, sharing about a real world experience, is just something else.

I feel bad I didn’t take a picture of the lightning talks board and I only remember the attendee is called Linus, if you get to see this post please let’s connect!

Thank you Grusp for having me on stage, Claranet Italia for supporting my DevRel journey and everyone who attended the event, such a magical one!

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm language supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

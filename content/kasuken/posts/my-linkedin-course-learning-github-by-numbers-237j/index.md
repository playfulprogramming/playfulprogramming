# Introduction

A few months ago I started to talk about my journey as a Technical Instructor for LinkedIn Learning.

<!-- ::end:link-preview -->

By the end of January my course "Learning GitHub" has been released and people start to watch it.

In this post I will publish some updates time to time to see how the course is going and and understand especially user feedback and whether I can improve anything.

# April 2023

At the end of April I reached almost 5k learners on my LinkedIn course.
It was one of the goals I set for myself: 1k, 3k, 5k, 10k, 20k.

The course reached **4852** learners with at least 20% of the course watched.
**131** people shared the course on LinkedIn and **112**liked the course.

learners reviewed my course and based on the percentage:

- 101 people reviewed with 5 ⭐
- 29 people reviewed with 4 ⭐
- 8 people reviewed with 3 ⭐
- 4 people reviewed with 2 ⭐
- 1 people reviewed with 1 ⭐

This means if the same percentage of people wrote a review

- 3300 people reviewed with 5 ⭐
- 970 people reviewed with 4 ⭐
- 290 people reviewed with 3 ⭐
- 145 people reviewed with 2 ⭐
- 24 people reviewed with 1 ⭐

The average rating is: **4.5**.
The only very bad reviews are about my English accent, but it's something I know and I am working on it.
By the way, this bad reviews came from American people. It means it's not enough for us but maybe for a non-native my English is ok.

# March 2023

Very near the end of March I reached 3k learners on my LinkedIn course.
It was one of the goals I set for myself: 1k, 3k, 5k, 10k, 20k.
Those are pretty much the goals I put in front of me.
This means that I reached about 55 learners each day for the previous 60 days (since the course was released).
Actually there was an increase in numbers because after one month I had "only" 1,000 learners.
Most likely the course link is now much more visible than before.

To keep track of the evolution of the course over time, I created myself an excel file with some graphs and some statistics that I go to update from time to time, almost once every two days and always after lunch.
It seems that LinkedIn updates the statistics after lunch.

Some interesting things have come out.

![Excel Overview](./0ni1c2um2h5tpyct4g2b.png)

The course reached **3304** learners with at least 20% of the course watched.
**92** people shared the course on LinkedIn and \*\*86 \*\*liked the course.

111 learners reviewed my course and based on the percentage:

- 78 people reviewed with 5 ⭐
- 22 people reviewed with 4 ⭐
- 4 people reviewed with 3 ⭐
- 3 people reviewed with 2 ⭐
- 1 people reviewed with 1 ⭐

This means if the same percentage of people wrote a review

- 2313 people reviewed with 5 ⭐
- 661 people reviewed with 4 ⭐
- 132 people reviewed with 3 ⭐
- 99 people reviewed with 2 ⭐
- 17 people reviewed with 1 ⭐

The average rating is: **4.6**.

Honestly I am happy about the result after two months.
Looking forward for the April statistics!

Navigating open spaces can be challenging for anyone, but for neurodivergent individuals, it can present a unique set of difficulties. From **sensory overload** to **social interactions**, the open space environment can be overwhelming. However, with the right strategies and mindset, it's possible for neurodivergent individuals to not only survive but thrive in these settings.

I came up with these "strategies" because I've been going to the office more often in the last few months, and I needed to find a solution for myself.

Understanding Neurodiversity:
🌈 Before delving into survival strategies, it's essential to understand what neurodiversity means. Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in human brain function and behavior. Neurodivergent individuals may have conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (**ASD**), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (**ADHD**), dyslexia, or other cognitive differences. These differences can affect how they perceive and interact with the world around them.

Survival Strategies:

**Know Your Triggers**
🔍 Identify the specific sensory triggers that may cause discomfort or overwhelm in open spaces. This could include bright lights, loud noises, crowded areas, or certain textures. Once you recognize your triggers, you can develop strategies to minimize their impact.

**Use Noise-Cancelling Headphones**
🎧 Noise-cancelling headphones can be a lifesaver in noisy environments. They help block out distracting sounds and create a more manageable auditory experience.

**Establish Safe Spaces**
🛋️ Identify safe spaces within the open environment where you can retreat if you feel overwhelmed. This could be a quiet corner, a designated relaxation area, or even a nearby outdoor space.
Honestly, sometimes, I go to the bathroom for a few minutes, just to have my own isolation moment.

**Practice Grounding Techniques**
🧘 Grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment and alleviate feelings of anxiety or sensory overload. Examples include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, or focusing on tactile sensations.

**Set Boundaries**
🚫 It's okay to set boundaries with others in open spaces, especially when it comes to social interactions. Let people know if you need space or if certain behaviors are triggering for you.

**Utilize Fidget Toys**
🌀 Fidget toys, such as stress balls or fidget spinners, can provide sensory stimulation and help channel nervous energy in a productive way.

**Seek Support**
🤝 Don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or professionals who understand your neurodivergent needs. Having a support system can make navigating open spaces much easier.

Conclusion:
Surviving in open spaces as a neurodivergent individual requires self-awareness, preparation, and the implementation of coping strategies. By understanding your triggers, planning ahead, and utilizing support systems, you can navigate open environments with greater confidence and resilience. Remember that your neurodiversity is a unique strength, and with the right tools and mindset, you can thrive in any setting.

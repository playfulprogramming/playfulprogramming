As a developer, my workdays are filled with coding, designing, and collaborating with colleagues both in-person and remotely. Over time, I've curated a selection of essential items that help me stay productive, comfortable, and connected throughout the day. 

**What's in My Bag When I Go to the Office:**

1. **Surface Laptop 4**: This powerful laptop is my go-to device for development tasks, offering a perfect blend of performance and portability. It's very lightweight and this is very useful because sometimes I move around the office with it.

2. **Logitech MX Master**: With its ergonomic design and customizable features, the Logitech MX Master ensures precise control and comfort during long hours of work.

3. **External Webcam**: For crystal-clear video quality during virtual meetings and presentations, an external webcam is indispensable. In addition, I don't like when people use the built-in webcam from the laptop. You see the other people from bottom to top and not in the eyes!

4. **Wrist Support for Mouse**: To prevent wrist strain and maintain ergonomic comfort, I always carry a wrist support for my mouse.

5. **Microsoft 75% Keyboard**: My preferred keyboard from home offers familiarity and efficiency, enhancing my typing speed and accuracy. I connect the laptop to a big external monitor and I keep my laptop closed and connected to the docking station. This is why I need an external keyboard and I prefer to use mine.

6. **iPhone Max Headphones**: These headphones provide excellent audio quality and noise-canceling features, perfect for staying focused in a busy office environment. As I mentioned in another post, I use Endel app during the day and it's perfect with these headphones!

7. **iPhone Pro Headphones**: With a similar set of features to the iPhone Max Headphones, these provide flexibility for different tasks and preferences. For instance, if I have to take a call from the phone, I use the Pro and not the Max.

From essential tools like my Surface Laptop 4 and Logitech MX Master to accessories like external webcams and ergonomic wrist supports, each item plays a vital role in enhancing my work experience. By having these essentials at hand, I'm equipped to tackle any challenges and collaborate effectively with my colleagues, whether in-person or remotely.

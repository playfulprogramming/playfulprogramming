If you’re anything like me, your Microsoft Teams chat list can go from *zen garden* to *dumpster fire* in a matter of hours.

After months of context switching, lost messages, and accidentally ghosting my colleagues (sorry!), I decided to treat Teams like a system, not just a chat app. Here’s how I organize my chats to stay sane and focused, using built-in features and a few low-tech tricks.

## ✅ 1. Use Favorites (Pinned) Wisely

You’ve probably already pinned your favorite contacts. But you can take it further:

- **Pin group chats**, not just individuals, think project channels, leadership convos, or recurring syncs
- **Rename chats** with the pencil icon so you can scan them at a glance

> 💡 Pro Tip: Limit yourself to around 8–10 pinned chats to avoid clutter.

Here’s how I categorize mine:

- 🔁 **Daily Standup / Core Team**
- 👨‍💻 **Manager / Reports**
- 💬 **1:1s** (mentoring, coaching, etc.)
- 🚧 **Ongoing Projects**
- 🧠 **Brainstorm or R\&D**
- 🆘 **Support / Helpdesk**
- 🎉 **Fun / Social**

Keep it tidy, keep it intentional.

## 📂 2. Leverage the Search Bar Like a Folder System

You don’t need folders when you can use **search like a power user**. Treat it like your own on-demand archive.

Try these:

- `from:John` → shows all chats with John
- `subject:<group name>` → useful if you renamed group chats
- Search by **keywords**, **dates**, or **file names** to dig up past conversations

> 💡 Tip: Save your favorite search patterns in Notion or OneNote for quick reuse.

Example:

```
Standup: from:marketing team
Design Discussions: from:UX group
```

## 🧹 3. Hide & Clean Up

Not every chat deserves front-row status.

Make it a habit to **unpin or hide** chats that are:

- 💤 Inactive
- 📣 Noisy or low-priority
- 👻 Ones you don’t need to see daily

Right-click the chat > **Hide**. That’s it.

> ✨ Bonus: You’ll still get notified if someone messages you, hiding doesn’t mute the chat.

## 🗓️ 4. Use Chat for Agenda Items

Recurring meetings? Don’t just talk — **organize the conversation**.

Here’s how:

- Create a dedicated 1:1 or group chat for the meeting
- **Rename the chat** (e.g., `Weekly Sync - Marketing`)
- Drop questions, links, or async updates *before* the call

> 🧠 Think of it as your meeting’s shared notebook — searchable, collaborative, and always there when you need to follow up.

It turns every recurring meeting into an async-friendly thread. Win-win.

## 🧭 Optional: Keep a Map Outside Teams

If your Teams feels overwhelming, create a simple **“Chat Map”** in Notion, OneNote, or even a sticky note.

Structure it by cadence or topic, like:

```
🟢 Daily
- Core team
- Tech lead
- Design sync

🟡 Weekly
- PM check-in
- Sales feedback loop

🔵 Monthly
- Retro
- All-hands Q&A

```

You can even **link back to the actual Teams chats** (right-click > “Copy link”).

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

Microsoft Teams doesn't have to be a mess.

It’s not about adding more tools — it’s about using what you already have, better.

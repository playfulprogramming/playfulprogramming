Last week, I had the opportunity to attend Codemotion 2023, one of the biggest tech conferences in Europe, as a speaker and an ambassador. It was a fantastic experience that I want to share with you in this post.

## PreConference Day

I arrived in Milan the day before the conference, and I went to the venue to finalize the streaming setup in the Community Area. There, I met some other ambassadors and more or less the entire Codemotion Teams. They were all very friendly and helpful, and I felt welcomed and appreciated.

I came back to the hotel for some calls and meetings, and before going to bed, I checked the slides and the demo for my session the next day. I was going to talk about how to build a serverless web app with Azure Functions and Blazor WebAssembly, a topic that I am very passionate about.

## Day 1

I arrived at the venue early to check again the streaming. Speakers started to arrive, as well as attendees. I hung around with other speakers and made some selfies with attendees (they asked). It was nice to see some familiar faces and meet new people who share the same interests.

I had a few calls for work in the morning, but I managed to squeeze them in between sessions. After lunch, I had my session with more or less 250 attendees. Everything went well, apart from a technical issue. I was not able to duplicate my screen, but just extend it. So, I had my main screen with the code on the second screen, in front of me but below the stage. It was tricky, but I found a way to deliver the session.

A lot of people asked me questions after the session and stopped me when I walked around to compliment me on the content of the session. I was very happy and grateful for their feedback and curiosity.

In the late afternoon, I introduced on stage, for the first time, my friend Davide. I mentored him for about a month and a half before the event about public speaking (I am also writing a small ebook about that). He talked about how to use Azure Cognitive Services to build smart applications. His session went well, as I expected. He was confident and engaging, and he handled questions like a pro.

After the last sessions, we had a speakers dinner at a nice restaurant nearby. It was a lot of fun to chat with them and share our experiences and stories.

## Day 2

Unfortunately, it was the last day of the conference. I didn’t have too much stuff to do, so I hung around in the venue to meet friends, make selfies and talk with people. I attended one or two interesting sessions about AI and cloud computing.

In the late afternoon, I introduced Laura on stage. It was not her first time speaking at a conference, but it was her first time speaking alone. She talked about how to use Azure DevOps to automate your CI/CD pipeline. I mentored her as well, and I was very proud of her performance. The session went well, maybe even better than expected. She was clear and concise, and she showed some cool demos.

I am happy about my two “wannabe speakers”. I hope they will continue in these kind of activities and inspire others to do the same.

I came back home very late because all the transport were delayed. But it was worth it. Codemotion 2023 was an amazing event that I will never forget. Thank you to all the organizers, speakers, sponsors and attendees who made it possible. See you next year!

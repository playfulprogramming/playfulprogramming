This is a series about web components. I did the most research I could on topic and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
to write about it!

Worth mentioning that I wrote on behalf of and while under the employment of [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) and I'd love to thank them
for allowing me to spend time on this.

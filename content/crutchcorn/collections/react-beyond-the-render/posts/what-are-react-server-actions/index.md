In our last article, we talked about [React's `use` hook and Async Server Components](/posts/what-is-react-suspense-and-async-rendering); both means to handle async operations to display in a render.

In the conclusion of that article, I hinted that there was going to be more to the Server Components story. Well, sure enough there is in the form of React Server Actions.

First though, let's talk about the client-side once again.

# What are React `<form>` actions?

Let's say that we're building a todo list application:

```jsx
function App() {
	const id = useRef(0);
	const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
	const [todoInput, setTodoInput] = useState("");

	function addTodo(e) {
		e.preventDefault();
		setTodos([...todos, { value: todoInput, id: ++id.current }]);
	}

	return (
		<>
			<ul>
				{todos.map((todo) => {
					return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.value}</li>;
				})}
			</ul>
			<form onSubmit={addTodo}>
				<input
					name="todo"
					value={todoInput}
					onChange={(e) => setTodoInput(e.target.value)}
				/>
				<button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
			</form>
		</>
	);
}
```

<iframe data-frame-title="React Classic Todo - StackBlitz" src="pfp-code:./react-classic-todo?template=node&embed=1&file=src%2Fmain.jsx" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

This works, but notice how we're having to `preventDefault` here. This is because we're sidestepping [`<form>`'s native `submit` event's behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event); [submitting a form using the `action` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/action).

Luckily, the React core team has noticed this and introduced a means to passing a function in the `action` property in our client-side React applications:

```jsx
function App() {
	const id = useRef(0);
	const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

	async function addTodo(formData) {
		const todo = formData.get("todo");
		setTodos([...todos, { value: todo, id: ++id.current }]);
	}

	return (
		<>
			<ul>
				{todos.map((todo) => {
					return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.value}</li>;
				})}
			</ul>
			<form action={addTodo}>
				<input name="todo" />
				<button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
			</form>
		</>
	);
}
```

This allows us to write less code and focus less on default DOM behavior and shift our efforts to shipping code.

Now that we've seen how `<form>` actions work on the client, let's move back to the server and look at React server actions:

# What are React Server Actions?

In short; React Server Actions are a way to call server-side code in React's client-side rendering. If asynchronous server components with `await` in them allow you to pass server data to the client, server actions enable you to pass data back from the client to the server.

![The server passes down data via async server components and is passed back data via server actions](back-and-forth-server-actions.svg)

However, to pass a function from a server component down to the client we must designate our functions we want to pass with a special boundary string.

<!-- ::in-content-ad title="Consider supporting" body="Donating any amount will help towards further development of articles like this." button-text="Visit our Open Collective" button-href="https://opencollective.com/playfulprogramming" -->

# What is `"use server"`?

`"use server"` is the boundary string in React server apps that allows us to mark a function as "ready to pass to the client".

Let's take our previous todo list and migrate the state to the server. This way all of our friends can see our shopping list!

We'll start by using [async server components](/posts/what-is-react-suspense-and-async-rendering#What-are-React-Async-Server-Components) to pass our todo list in from the server's database:

```jsx
// Theoretical API from a database wrapper
import { getTodos } from "./todos";

export default async function Todo() {
	const todos = await getTodos();
	return (
		<>
			<ul>
				{todos.map((todo) => {
					return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.value}</li>;
				})}
			</ul>
        	<!-- This form doesn't work yet -->
			<form>
				<input name="todo" />
				<button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
			</form>
		</>
	);
}
```

Now we have a way to pass data to the client, but not a way to get the user's input back. Let's fix that by passing a server action to the client and using `<form action={}/>` to call this function for us:

```jsx
import { addTodoToDatabase, getTodos } from "./todos";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default async function Todo() {
	const todos = await getTodos();
	async function addTodo(formData) {
		"use server";
		const todo = formData.get("todo");
		await addTodoToDatabase(todo);
		// Refresh the page to see the new todo
		redirect("/");
	}
	return (
		<>
			<ul>
				{todos.map((todo) => {
					return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.value}</li>;
				})}
			</ul>
			<form action={addTodo}>
				<input name="todo" />
				<button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
			</form>
		</>
	);
}
```

<iframe data-frame-title="Next.js Server Actions Server Comps - StackBlitz" src="pfp-code:./nextjs-server-actions-server-comps?template=node&embed=1&file=app%2Fpage.jsx" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

Now if we:

- Type something in the `<input/>`
- Click "Add Todo"
- Wait a moment

We'll see the todo we typed show up for all of our users on the page.

> Keep in mind, this is using REST APIs, so it won't auto-refresh the page for all users, just the user who added the todo.

## Adding in client-side components

Notice that we're only exclusively using a server-component in the example above. Because of this, we don't have any loading indicator for the time the server is adding our todo.

Let's add a `useState` in our client-component to solve this user experience problem:

```jsx
import { Todo } from "./client";
import { addTodoToDatabase, getTodos } from "./todos";

export default async function Home() {
	const todos = await getTodos();

	async function addTodo(formData) {
		"use server";
		const todo = formData.get("todo");
		await addTodoToDatabase(todo);
	}

	return <Todo todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} />;
}
```

```jsx
// client.jsx
"use client";

import { useCallback, useState } from "react";

export function Todo({ todos, addTodo }) {
	const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

	const addTodoAndRefresh = useCallback(async (formData) => {
		await addTodo(formData);
		window.location.reload();
	}, []);

	return (
		<>
			{isLoading && <p>Adding todo...</p>}
			<ul>
				{todos.map((todo) => {
					return <li key={todo.id}>{todo.value}</li>;
				})}
			</ul>
			<form
				action={addTodoAndRefresh}
				onSubmit={() => {
					// We're using onSubmit so that we don't have to wait for the server
					// to get the request before we set isLoading to true
					setIsLoading(true);
				}}
			>
				<input disabled={isLoading} name="todo" />
				<button disabled={isLoading} type="submit">
					Add Todo
				</button>
			</form>
		</>
	);
}
```

<iframe data-frame-title="Next.js Server Actions Client Comps - StackBlitz" src="pfp-code:./nextjs-server-actions-client-comps?template=node&embed=1&file=app%2Fclient.jsx" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

Instead of passing a server action from a server component, we could also mark a whole file as `"use server"` and import it from there;

```jsx
// server-actions.js
"use server";

import { addTodoToDatabase } from "./todos";

export async function addTodo(formData) {
    const todo = formData.get("todo");
    await addTodoToDatabase(todo);
}
```

```jsx
// client.jsx
"use client";

import { addTodo } from "./server-actions";
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";

export function Todo({ todos, addTodo }) {
	const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

	const addTodoAndRefresh = useCallback(async (formData) => {
		await addTodo(formData);
		window.location.reload();
	}, []);

	return (
		// ...
	);
}
```

> **Be careful what you export:**
>
> Don't mark your whole database API file as `"use server"`, otherwise it makes it easier to accidentally cause a security issue by exposing functions you might not wanted to've done otherwise.

## What happens if you don't mark a function with `"use server"`?

If you forget to mark your server action with the `"use server"` string, like so;

```jsx
// Server component
import { Todo } from "./client";
import { getTodos } from "./todos";

export default async function Home() {
	const todos = await getTodos();
	const addTodo = () => {
		// ...
	};
	return <Todo todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} />;
}
```

You get the following error, reminding you to explicitly mark your function as being ready to pass to the client:

```
тип Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with "use server".
<... todos={[...]} addTodo={function}>
^^^^^^^^^^
```

This is a safety feature so you don't end up enabling the client to call functions that aren't allowed.

## Are synchronous functions allowed in React server actions? 

No. Only `async` functions are allowed in server actions. If you forget to mark your action as `async`;

```jsx
// Server component
import { Todo } from "./client";
import { getTodos } from "./todos";

export default async function Home() {
	const todos = await getTodos();
	const addTodo = () => {
        "use server"
		console.log("Testing");
	};
	return <Todo todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} />;
}
```

You'll receive the following error:

```
Error:
  ├Ч Server actions must be async functions
```

## Can you define server actions in a client component file?

No. You cannot mix-and-match server action definitions within your client component files. If you do the following:

```jsx
"use client"

export function Todo({ todos }) {
  // ...
  
  export async function addTodo(formData) {
    "use server";
    // ...
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      <form
        action={addTodo}
      >
        {/* ... */}
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

You'll see an error that looks like:

```
Error:
  ├Ч It is not allowed to define inline "use server" annotated Server Actions in Client Components.
  тФВ To use Server Actions in a Client Component, you can either export them from a separate file with "use server" at the top, or pass them down through props from a Server Component.

> **Remember where to place your server actions:**
> Server actions can only be defined in a file with `"use server"` at the top or passed in via a server component marked with `"use server"` at the top of the function definition.

# Why are React Server Actions significant?

React Server Actions not only make it easier to call data from the server from the client, but they play an important role in providing your applications ["progressive enhancement"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement); they enable your server actions to call a server's function even when the user has JavaScript disabled in their browser.

> Keep in mind that while your server action will go through, any client-ran React code (IE `useEffect`) will still fail to execute when JavaScript is disabled.

For example, assume you're building a payment form:
![A payment form with card information and more](./shadcn_payment.png)

> This payment card graphic comes from [`shadcn/ui`'s examples](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/cards)

You want this payment form to be bulletproof. Any user having to attempt a re-purchase will likely not return to your site; leading to lost sales.

If your user doesn't have JavaScript enabled but you've implemented Server Actions; no problem. The user's purchase will still go through.

> But this seems a bit like an edge-case, doesn't it? After all, [according to a survey from WebAIM showed that 99.7% of users have JavaScript enabled](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#javascript) and I can't imagine many folks that would intentionally turn it off.

While that may be true for some use-cases, consider the following examples:

- A user in a developing country where data is expensive, disabling JavaScript could save money.
- A user on a subway train with limited cellular network; able to download the HTML but failed the JavaScript bundle download.
- A user with haywire browser extensions that has disabled the JavaScript on your page due to interference; either due to a bug or adblock.
- A user that works at a business that has strict security requirements and limits the loading of JavaScript on their network.

All of these are possible scenarios for your users. The more users you account for, the more money your organization can make.

# Conclusion

React Server Actions make for a wonderful way of intermingling server and client state. It's never been easier to write code for React applications that span between both the frontend and backend alike. Moreover, it's only going to get better with time.

But there's one more thing I still want to cover about React Server Components left... Let's look at `useFormState` and `useFormStatus` next time!

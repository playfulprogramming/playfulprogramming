# Event Targets

// Minimum targets. WCAG 2.1 says 44x44 (citation?)

# Mouse events

// TODO: `dblclick` and `click` and middle mouse click to recreate `a` link behavior (like our cards)

// TODO: Use CSS!, not JS (for hover states, focus states)

# Scroll animations

// TODO: talk about scroll jank and how that can be a problem

// TODO: Talk about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll-driven_animations


# Pointers

// TODO: More than `cursor: pointer` to show intent of mouse event



## A note on custom cursors

// TODO: Write: Generally a bad idea to replace the cursor because cognitive disabilities

This is a series about web forms. Whilst it may sound trivial, forms are very complex components that contain a lot of functionality that needs to be easy to use, accessible, and customizable.

Different frameworks handle forms in their own way, with their own set of built-in features. In this collection we'll discuss how React, Angular and Vue do it, and talk about how to maximize their effectiveness.

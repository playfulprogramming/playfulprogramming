# The Anatomy of an Efficient Message

There's a lot that goes into writing an effective message to your team. While casual conversations can to be aimlessly entertaining, placing an objective on a given piece of communication shifts the goalpost.

Instead of aiming for delight, your primary goal is now to inform, enable change, and be straightforward while doing so.

To make that a reality, you can follow a few patterns to enhance the effectiveness of your messages.

## Respect Your Peer's Notifications

In engineering, [flow state](/posts/in_person_vs_remote_teams) is extremely important to an individual's productivity. A large part of getting into flow state is uninterrupted time to focus on a given task; something that can't be achieved when notifications are being flung in from every direction.

As such, many engineers will put their devices on "mute" and work on their tasks. It's not until they're completed with their task that they'll then go through any communication they missed during that time. This is often called **"Asynchronous communication"**, where you engage in discussions back-and-forth when the respective parties have time.

This is very different from **"Synchronous communication"** like a phone call, where you expect back-and-forth at the same time to get on the same page.

The problem is that many treat messaging like a form of synchronous communication, when it's best served as async comms.

For example, some:

- Send "Hello" or some other greeting and wait for a reply before following up.
- Ask if they can ask a question; "Hey, can I ask something?". They similarly wait for a reply before asking.

While both of these are common affairs in speaking conversations, neither is particularly useful via message.

> "Why not?"

Well, let's consider a case where you're interacting with folks from another team. You want to ask how a policy procedure should be carried out and it's their procedure.

----------

"Hey, are you around?"

You wait for a reply. Hours pass until finally:

"Oops, sorry, I wasn't. What's up?"

An after-hours reply. Turns out that they had a long group meeting. The next day you log in:

"No worries! How do I do _X_?"

You don't hear from them until late the next day once more; they had a family emergency.

-------

See, if you had asked "How do I do _X_?" in your initial "Hey are you around?" message, you may have gotten a reply a day sooner.

This problem grows exponentially when your team is in different timezones or work schedules as well, since the means of your communication inherently have to be asynchronous most of the time.

This is why I suggest adding as much context as you can in your initial message. Use async comms the way they're intended.

## Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

- Start messages with your ask, provide context after
- This is crucial for communicating with busy people. 



## Adding Actionability

- Provide the ask in the initial message
- If on the other end; Ask what actions need to be done or if it's just an FYI



## Focus on Formatting

Make things glanceable as much as possible





# Engineering Your Team's Comms

## Sync vs. Async

- "This could have been an email" 
- Provide [grading rubric](https://thismeetingcouldhavebeenanemail.org/) for when to make one or another



## Synthesizing Summaries

- Provide funnel point for long-running comms (a summary doc for threads and such)

  

## Default to Documentable Communication

- Default to public channels

- Add transcription mention for sync chats



# Demonstrating Leadership

## Seek to Understand First 

- Always start by asking questions (even if you know the topic extremely well, asking questions helps you understand pain-points)

## Systemically Adding Rationale

- "Because I said so" (how to systemically add rationale in decision-making)



## Practice Active Listening

- Summarize what you've heard



## Build, Don't Block

- "Yes, and" (play off of others' excitement, even if redirecting it) ["That could be cool! We'll have to loop back on that in the future. For now, let's see how we can build a foundation to make it there"]



## Praise in Public, Correct in Private

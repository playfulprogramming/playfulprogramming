// TODO: Write this. This is your "communications toolkit" or something

# The Anatomy of an Efficient Message

## Respect Your Peer's Notifications

- Don't send "Hello" only as first message, include context on your ask
- "Don't ask to ask" (likewise, don't ask if you can ask a question; just ask the question)



## Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

- Start messages with your ask, provide context after
- This is crucial for communicating with busy people. 



## Adding Actionability

- Provide the ask in the initial message
- If on the other end; Ask what actions need to be done or if it's just an FYI



## Focus on Formatting

Make things glanceable as much as possible





# Engineering Your Team's Comms

## Sync vs. Async

- "This could have been an email" 
- Provide [grading rubric](https://thismeetingcouldhavebeenanemail.org/) for when to make one or another



## Synthesizing Summaries

- Provide funnel point for long-running comms (a summary doc for threads and such)

  

## Default to Documentable Communication

- Default to public channels

- Add transcription mention for sync chats



# Demonstrating Leadership

## Seek to Understand First 

- Always start by asking questions (even if you know the topic extremely well, asking questions helps you understand pain-points)

## Systemically Adding Rationale

- "Because I said so" (how to systemically add rationale in decision-making)



## Practice Active Listening

- Summarize what you've heard



## Build, Don't Block

- "Yes, and" (play off of others' excitement, even if redirecting it) ["That could be cool! We'll have to loop back on that in the future. For now, let's see how we can build a foundation to make it there"]



## Praise in Public, Correct in Private

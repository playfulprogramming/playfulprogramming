So:

- "No hello" (don't send "Hello" only as first message, include context on your ask)
- "Don't ask to ask" (likewise, don't ask if you can ask a question; just ask the question)
- "BLUF" (bottom-line up-front; start messages with your ask, provide context after)
- "This could have been an email" (When to decide async vs sync comms) [provide [grading rubric](https://thismeetingcouldhavebeenanemail.org/) for when to make one or another]
- "Because I said so" (how to systemically add rationale in decision-making)
- Provide funnel point for long-running comms (a summary doc for threads and such)
- Adding actionability ("Provide the ask in the initial message" OR "Ask what actions need to be done or if it's just an FYI")
- Default to public, documentable comms (add transcription mention)
- "Praise in public, criticize in private"
- Practice Active Listening (summarize what you've heard)
- Focus on formatting (make things glanceable as much as possible)

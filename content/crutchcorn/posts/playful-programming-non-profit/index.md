It's true; after many years as operating without a formal organization backing our efforts: **Playful Programming is now a California Non-Profit.**

![A pair of scissors cutting a ribbon](./non-profit.png)

# Why are we doing this?

From [our early inception under our older name, "Unicorn Utterances"](/posts/a-complete-history-of-uu) to [our modern revamp and rebrand to "Playful Programming"](/posts/rebrand-to-playful-programming), we've always had the same goal:

"Create engaging learning resources to bring others into software development and grow their skills to the next level."

This goal has enabled us to stay focused while building out our suite of teaching tools for others to benefit from.

However, while many organizations' goals often start ambitiously and with positive intent, it's far too often to see a well-meaning group end up fighting against their own cause. And regardless of the reasons, the result is often the same: The end user suffers.

We believe education, formal or otherwise, can enable an individual to escape bad scenarios they are often placed within due to systemic reasons. Even [I myself remember a time when I couldn't afford groceries consistently. It wasn't until many years (and learning resources) later that I can now help myself and my family stay afloat](/collections/framework-field-guide#why-free-story).

This is why we're moving towards a more accountable system of governance. Now, not only do our [core values](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming/blob/main/CORE_VALUES.md) guide us towards enabling transparency and well-doing for the general community, but we have a legal requirement to comply with our own objectives and key success metrics.

# What does this mean?

![A blank clipboard with a pencil](./whats_changing.png)

When we say we're a "California Non-Profit", what we mean is that we're a **California Public Benefit Corporation**.

A Public Benefit Corporation is a type of legal entity that incorporates us, helps us to structure our organization in a more balanced way, and gives us legal protection.

It's worth noting that when many hear "non-profit", they often think of a 501(c)(3) organization, which we are not yet.

> 501(c)(3) is a federal tax designation that allows us to treat donations as charitable and tax-deductible.

Today, we are a public benefit corporation aiming to become a 501(c)(3) in the near future.

# How does this work?

A non-profit has three different kind of important people to know about:

- Executives
- Officers
- Board members

The executive side of things includes a: **Executive Director** (AKA CEO). They handle  and run day-to-day operations.

The three ***required*** officers are:

1. Chairperson: leads meetings, sets agendas
2. Secretary: takes meeting minutes and is responsible for record keeping
3. Treasurer: responsible for financial records

# Who's involved?

![A pin board showing a list of printed photos with unicorns on each pin connected by a string](./whos_involved.png)

I'm beyond elated to share our board with you all; it's filled with many industry titans and some of the downright best humans I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

Going alphabetically, we have seven board members:

- [Jessica "Jess" Temporal](/people/jtemporal)
- [Micah Dutro](/people/MDutro)
- [Obi Baratt](/people/obibaratt)

Of these seven board members, three are officers:

- Chairperson: [James Fenn](/people/fennifith)
- Secretary: [Micah Dutro](/people/MDutro)
- Treasurer: [Obi Baratt](/people/obibaratt)

While I, [Corbin Crutchley](/people/crutchcorn), am our Executive Director.

# What's next?

![A unicorn in a lab coat with a computer monitor and science-y beakers on the desk](./whats_next.png)

As we grow our non-profit further than it is today, we have a lot ahead of us. From aiming towards 501(c)(3) status to refining our policies and procedures, it's going to be a fun and wild ride getting everything set up.

Beyond our non-profit goals, we have **huge** plans for 2025 and after. While there's some stuff we're able to talk about:

1) Continuing and growing our weekly Discord Book Club, where we talk about a new programming article every week
2) [Inviting and finding new authors and contributors to join us](/join-us)
3) Publishing the second and third books of "[The Framework Field Guide](https://framework.guide/)"
4) Investigating the possibility of building out video content for our site
5) Developing a new in-house Content Management System (CMS) to make article publication easier

There's even more that we have in the works that we're not yet ready to share publicly.

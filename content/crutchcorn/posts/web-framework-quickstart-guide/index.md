Not that long ago, figuring out how to generate a code template for your favorite framework was a challenge in itself. Older configuration tools like Webpack, Gulp and Grunt had complex configurations to get things up-and-running.

Thankfully, today it's much easier to get a quick [client-side application](/posts/what-is-ssr-and-ssg#csr) up-and-running with your preferred framework.

Let's take a quick look at how we can scaffold a project for React, Angular, and Vue:

<!-- ::start:tabs -->

# React

While React used to have a dedicated tool called `create-react-app`, it's [no longer suggested to use for modern React apps.](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741)

Instead, we can use a tool built by the Vue maintainers (of all things!) that supports React and other frameworks as first-party integrations: [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/).

Using Vite, we can quickly generate a React project.

### Pre-requisites

To get started with Vite, there's a few things we should know about first:

- [Know what Node and NPM are and how to use them](/posts/how-to-use-npm)
- [How to install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

That's it!

## Usage

Now that we have our pre-requisites out of the way, let's create a React template using Vite:

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

This will start a script that guides you through an interactive setup process.

1) First, give Vite your project name:

![The command asking you for "Project name" with "vite-project" pre-filled](./create_vite_step_1.png)

2) Select "React" as your framework:

!["Select a framework" dropdown in the CLI with "React" highlighted](./select_react.png)

3) Select "JavaScript" or "TypeScript":

!["Select a variant" with four options: TypeScript, TypeScript + SWC, JavaScript, JavaScript + SWC](./select_react_javascript.png)

> If you're unfamiliar with TypeScript, it's an addition to JavaScript that allows you to add "compile-time types" to your code.

You may select SWC if you'd like here as well. At a high level, it's an alternative method of compiling your code from the default. You may or may not notice a speed increase if you select it, but errors may be harder to debug as it's less commonly used.

> **Note:**
> If you're following along with my book series ["The Framework Field Guide"](/collections/framework-field-guide), please select "JavaScript". TypeScript is useful but complex and the series' code samples do not use TypeScript, nor does the series teach TypeScript.

4. Run the commands printed in the final output of Vite:

!["Done. Now run:" and a series of commands](./vite_react_done.png)

```shell
cd [your-project-name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. If all worked, once your packages are installed you should see this template screen:

![A page with "Vite + React" header, some interactive elements, and "Edit src/App.jsx" and save to test HMR](./vite_react_preview.png)

Now when you modify `src/App.jsx` (or `src/App.tsx` if you selected TypeScript) it will refresh the screen for you and preview your changes immediately.

> This auto-refresh on code change is called "HMR" or "Hot Module Reloading"

# Angular

The Angular team maintains a CLI tool that allows you to generate new projects, upgrade existing projects, and more called [**Angular CLI**](https://angular.dev/tools/cli).

Using Angular CLI, we can quickly generate an Angular project.

### Pre-requisites

To get started with Angular CLI, there's a few things we should know about first:

- [Know what Node and NPM are and how to use them](/posts/how-to-use-npm)

- [How to install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Install Angular CLI globally:

  ```shell
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

That's it!

## Usage

Now that we have our pre-requisites out of the way, let's create an Angular template using Angular CLI:

```shell
ng new my-app
```

This will start a script that guides you through an interactive setup process.

1. First, select if you want to write CSS or use a CSS pre-processor like [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](https://lesscss.org/):

![A CLI with the option "Which stylesheet format would you like to use?"](./angular_stylesheet_format.png)

> If you don't know what SCSS or Less are, that's okay. They're **optional** alternative methods for writing CSS with additional features.

It's suggested to select "CSS" for newcomers.

2. Then, tell Angular CLI if you want to use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG):

!["Do you want to enable SSR and SSG?"](./angular_ssr.png)

While "Server Side Rendering" (SSR) and "Static Site Generation" (SSG) are useful, I wouldn't recommend utilizing those tools for newcomers.

> If you want to learn what SSR and SSG _are_, [check out this article I wrote explaining each.](/posts/what-is-ssr-and-ssg)

3. Angular CLI will then start to generate the relevant files and install dependencies for your project:

![A series of commands with "CREATE" showing the created files](./angular_done.png)

Once this is done, run the following commands:

```shell
cd my-app
npm start
```

4. If all worked, once your packages are installed you should see this template screen:

![A preview page of your template up-and-running](./angular_preview.png)

Now when you modify any code in the project it will refresh the screen for you and preview your changes immediately.

# Vue

While Vue used to have a CLI tool aptly named "Vue CLI" that let you scaffold projects, it's been replaced by a new tool made by the Vue team: [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/).

![The Vite logo: A "V" with a lightning strike in the middle](./vite_og.png)

Using Vite, we can quickly generate a Vue project.

### Pre-requisites

- [Know what Node and NPM are and how to use them](/posts/how-to-use-npm)
- [How to install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```shell

![The command asking you for "Project name" with "vite-project" pre-filled](./create_vite_step_1.png)

2) Select "Vue" as your framework:

!["Select a framework" dropdown in the CLI with "Vue" highlighted](./select_vue.png)

3. Select "JavaScript" or "TypeScript":

!["Select a variant" with four options: "TypeScript", "JavaScript", "Customize with create-vue", and "Nuxt"](./vite_vue_variant.png)

> If you're unfamiliar with TypeScript, it's an addition to JavaScript that allows you to add "compile-time types" to your code.

4. Run the commands printed in the final output of Vite:

!["Done. Now run:" and a series of commands](./vite_vue_done.png)

```shell
cd [your-project-name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. If all worked, once your packages are installed you should see this template screen:

![[A page with "Vite + Vue" header, some interactive elements, and "Edit components/HelloWorld.vue" and save to test HMR]](./vite_vue_preview.png)

Now when you modify `components/HelloWorld.vue` or any other code in the project it will refresh the screen for you and preview your changes immediately.

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Keep in mind, this is only one option for configuring your code's build tooling. There's lots of other tools and options for configuring the aforementioned tools.

> Want to learn more about that? Check out my upcoming book called ["The Framework Field Guide: Ecosystem"](/collections/framework-field-guide#ecosystem-title), which walks you through each of the tools and how to properly configure each of them in-depth, regardless of which framework you use.

Happy hacking!

Today's an exciting day; Two programming communities are coming together to help re-enforce one another's goals in educating others.

The two communities in question?

1) ["This is Learning"](https://x.com/Thisis_Learning) (and the sub-project of ["This is Angular"](https://x.com/Thisis_Angular))

2) [Playful Programming](https://playfulprogramming.com)

Let's introduce each community and explain what this means for both communities.

# Introducing "This is Learning"

"This is Learning" was originally created in 2020 by [Santosh Yadav](https://www.santoshyadav.dev/) and [Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen](https://github.com/layzeedk) to bring together authors and share software development knowledge.

Santosh and Lars are both highly accomplished engineers and community leaders. Both receiving multi-year awards from prestigious organizations like GitHub, Microsoft, Google, and Nx for their efforts on "This is" as well as many other open-source projects.

It's no wonder, then, that since they started their project they've:

- [Had over 1480 articles released on their Dev.to community by over 175 authors](https://dev.to/this-is-learning) ([including 650 articles specifically about Angular](https://dev.to/this-is-angular))
- [Created 100 videos on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThisisTechTalks)
- [Ran a successful virtual conference in 2024](https://til-conf.netlify.app/)
- Created two courses for [NgRx](https://this-is-angular.github.io/ngrx-essentials-course/) and [RxJS](https://this-is-learning.github.io/rxjs-fundamentals-course/)
- [Sent out 50+ issues of their newsletter](https://thisislearning.substack.com/archive)

> As we migrate these resources to "Playful Programming" branding and our main website, these links may break over time. We will leave them as-is for historical context.

Throughout it all, they always remained strictly "not for profit" and encouraged cross-posting, self-controlled content ownership, and community wellbeing over all else.

# Introducing "Playful Programming"

"Playful Programming" was started by [James Fenn](http://jfenn.me/), [Evelyn Hathaway](https://playfulprogramming.com/people/evelynhathaway), and [myself (Corbin Crutchley)](https://github.com/crutchcorn) in [2019](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/uttering-hello-introduction-post/).

Playful Programming (originally called ["Unicorn Utterances"](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/rebrand-to-playful-programming/)) started as an alternative to a bootcamp that I worked in that I felt was acting predatory to the students in my area. Knowing that James and Evelyn were all-star engineers, I asked for their help to propel our mission — of teaching others in a transparent and helpful way — forward.

Since then, we as a community have:

- [Had over 230 articles released on our site from over 60 contributors](https://playfulprogramming.com/search/?q=*)
- [Ran a Discord community with 2700 members ](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T)

- [Made a bespoke highly performant and accessible website](https://playfulprogramming.com) 
  - [The site was built along the timeline of 7000+ commits](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming)
  - [Begun to introduce a dedicated backend and complex deployment infrastructure to make our site more scalable in the long-run](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/hoof)
  - [Created a robust design system with hundreds of design components and 300+ variables alone](https://www.figma.com/design/Ul8KB1Sc6etCNTRCRSc27z/Playful-Programming---Website?m=auto&t=jtN97SD9KIA9GZ09-6)
- [Had a mailing list with over 1500 subscribers](https://mailinglist.playfulprogramming.com/)
- [Started a **free** 12-week coding bootcamp teaching web development using our resources](https://playfulprogramming.com/events/sacramento-bootcamp/)

# Our future

// TODO: Talk about our plans for a CMS to make authoring articles easier.

// TODO: Talk about our plans to make our CMS fully git-backed for enforcing transparency and easy migrations away

// TODO: Talk about plans to integrate our CMS to Dev.to to mirror content from our site to theirs

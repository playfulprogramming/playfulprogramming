Today marks a major milestone for open-source education: **["This is Learning"](https://x.com/Thisis_Learning) and ["Playful Programming"](https://playfulprogramming.com) are joining forces.** We are bringing two communities together to reinforce our shared goal of transparent, accessible developer education.

Let's introduce each community and explain what this means for both communities.

# Introducing "This is Learning" (TiL)

![A text logo of "TiL"](./til_logo.png)

"This is Learning" (TiL) was originally created in 2020 by [Santosh Yadav](https://www.santoshyadav.dev/) and [Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen](https://github.com/layzeedk) to bring together authors and share software development knowledge.

Santosh and Lars are both highly accomplished engineers and community leaders. Both receiving multi-year awards from prestigious organizations like GitHub, Microsoft, Google, and Nx for their efforts on "This is" as well as many other open-source projects.

It's no wonder, then, that since they started their project they've:

- [Facilitated the release of over 1480 articles on their Dev.to community by over 175 authors](https://dev.to/this-is-learning)
  - [This includes 650 articles specifically about Angular in their "This is Angular" sub-brand](https://dev.to/this-is-angular)

- [Created 100 videos on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThisisTechTalks)
- [Ran a successful virtual conference in 2024](https://til-conf.netlify.app/)
- Created two courses for [NgRx](https://this-is-angular.github.io/ngrx-essentials-course/) and [RxJS](https://this-is-learning.github.io/rxjs-fundamentals-course/)
- [Sent out 50+ issues of their newsletter](https://thisislearning.substack.com/archive)

> As we migrate these resources to "Playful Programming" branding and our main website, these links may break over time. We will leave them as-is for historical context.

Throughout it all, they always remained strictly "not for profit" and encouraged cross-posting, self-controlled content ownership, and community wellbeing over all else.

# Introducing "Playful Programming" (PFP)

![Smiling cartoon unicorn with a bowtie](./pfp_logo.png)

"Playful Programming" (PFP) was started by [James Fenn](http://jfenn.me/), [Evelyn Hathaway](https://playfulprogramming.com/people/evelynhathaway), and [myself (Corbin Crutchley)](https://github.com/crutchcorn) in [2019](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/uttering-hello-introduction-post/).

Playful Programming (originally called ["Unicorn Utterances"](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/rebrand-to-playful-programming/)) started as an alternative to a bootcamp that I worked in that I felt was acting predatory to the students in my area. Knowing that James and Evelyn were all-star engineers, I asked for their help to propel our mission — of teaching others in a transparent and helpful way — forward.

> Want to learn more about Playful Programming's origins? [When we rebranded from "Unicorn Utterances" we wrote a historical article on our project that you can read on our site.](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/a-complete-history-of-uu/)

Since then, we as a community have:

- [Had over 230 articles released on our site from over 60 contributors](https://playfulprogramming.com/search/?q=*)
- [Ran a Discord community with 2700 members](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T)

- [Made a bespoke highly performant and accessible website](https://playfulprogramming.com) 
  - [The site was built along the timeline of 7000+ commits](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming)
  - [Begun to introduce a dedicated backend and complex deployment infrastructure to make our site more scalable in the long-run](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/hoof)
  - [Created a robust design system with hundreds of design components and 300+ variables alone](https://www.figma.com/design/Ul8KB1Sc6etCNTRCRSc27z/Playful-Programming---Website?m=auto&t=jtN97SD9KIA9GZ09-6)
- [Had a mailing list with over 1500 subscribers](https://mailinglist.playfulprogramming.com/)
- [Started a **free** 12-week coding bootcamp teaching web development using our resources](https://playfulprogramming.com/events/sacramento-bootcamp/)
- [Became a California non-profit](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/playful-programming-non-profit/)

That last item is one I'm particularly proud of. It continually reminds (and enforces) our goals to keep our content accessible and driven towards the community; not towards profits.

# Details about the merger

As both organizations have scaled, we've faced different challenges:

- For TiL, they've remained focused on the content. This has meant that they have a strong repertoire of content, but have focused less on other avenues of growth.

- Contrarily, PFP has developed a powerful brand, a "uniquely ours" website, and a larger community in our Discord. We're proud of what we've put out, but it does mean that our content catalog is comparatively weak.

After some discussion between Lars, Santosh, and myself, we realized that we'd be able to grow a substantially healthier community with a joint effort.

As such, **we will be doing the following** going forward:

- Retain Playful Programming's name, branding, and structure
- Keeping our board of directors as-is
- Rename This is Learning's Dev.to blog to "Playful Programming" and their Angular specific blog to "Playful Programming Angular"
- Continuing to run the "This is Tech Talks" podcast under Playful Programming
- Reposting authors of This is Learning's existing content to opt-into reposting their content to the Playful Programming website

Again, it's that last point that we've spent a considerable amount of time enabling. Twenty TiL authors agreed for us to port hundreds of their posts to our site. This required us to develop many new features for our site, but has resulted in **our site having 750+ articles present today!**

!["This brings our article count to 750+"](750_articles.png)

> **A note for TiL contributors:**
>
> While we've done our best to reach out to all existing contributors to TiL, we acknowledge that it's tough to keep up-to-date with every community we find ourselves in.
>
> As such, if you'd like to have your contents on our site or have feedback regarding this change, reach out to me on [any of my social media channels](https://crutchcorn.dev) and I'll help migrate your content or address concerns you might have.
>
> Regardless of if you'd like your content reposted onto our site, your Dev.to content will remain fully in-tact and all links to existing content should redirect on Dev.to's site.

# Our future

But this isn't all we have planned! We also intend on:

- Migrating TiL's RxJS and NgRx courses into Playful Programming's collections feature
- Creating topic-specific pages to explore content of (like "This is Angular" provided for the broader "This is Learning" community)
- Building out integrations with social media feeds to automatically promote authors' works

----

With this influx of new content and authors, we want to improve the writing experience. One concern we've heard from authors is challenges with posting to Playful's site. Today, [writing a post for our site includes making a pull request to our GitHub repo](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). While we've tried to reduce friction with that process as much as we can, we know that writing for Dev.to using a GUI is much easier to navigate.

As such, we're working incredibly hard on building out a custom CMS for our site. Here's a small mockup preview of such:

![A mockup of a post creation screen with fake images and tags](./pfp_cms_mockup.png)

> Why build out a custom CMS?

While there's [a long and well-researched answer to that question](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming/pull/1297), the long-story short is that we haven't found a CMS that allows our content to be stored in a Git repository with the features we want to support in the long run.

> Why do you want to store content in Git?

The biggest reason for wanting to store authors' contents in Git is that it's a systemic answer to our goals of remaining maximally transparent. If our values are ever mismatched from authors', we want an easy way for authors to take their whole dataset with them without needing to access an account or API token.

And while radical transparency is our primary motivator, creating our own CMS allows us to add features in the future like:

- Cross-posting to Dev.to instantly
- Social media feed promotion of our authors' material
- Additional components that markdown doesn't provide out-of-the-box
- Revision history from the editor itself
- Multi-player editing

And much more.

# Thank you

Neither "This is Learning" nor "Playful Programming" would be where we are today without you; the readers.

We're excited by our next chapter as we continue to serve the community with learning materials. There's still a great deal of work for us to accomplish, but we're driven by the northern star of those that we're able to serve.

We appreciate your continued support and hope to see you in our community.

Until next time,

\- Corbin Crutchley, Executive Director of Playful Programming

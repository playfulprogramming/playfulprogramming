One of the hardest parts of any front-end application (native application or website alike) is the data layer. Where do I store information? That question alone can cause lots of headaches when dealing with large-scale applications. Well, worry not, as we'll be going over some of the different options you have at your disposal in your React Native applications today.

# Key-Value Pair Storage {#default-preference}

Often, while creating settings options, it can be useful to store a simple key/value pairings of serializable data (like JSON). In the web world, we'd use `localStorage.` Ideally, we'd like a simple data storage for string-based data that has a `get,` a `set,` and a `clear` method to handle data for us. Luckily for us, there is!

[`react-native-default-preference`](https://github.com/kevinresol/react-native-default-preference) is an easy-to-add dependency that provides what we're looking for:

```
yarn add react-native-default-preference
```

Under-the-hood, it utilized native methods for storing data in a key-value manner. These APIs it employs is the [`SharedPreferences` API on Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences) and the [`UserDefaults` API on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults). This native code utilization should mean that not only is the data straightforward to access, but speedy as well.

# Secure Key-Value Pair Storage {#secure-key-store}

There may be an instance where you want to store a part of secure information to the device. For example, in [my mobile Git client I'm currently writing](https://gitshark.dev), I'm grabbing an access token from the GitHub API. This type of sensitive data introduces a new set of problems when it comes to storage; conventional means of storing data are easily accessed from external sources, leading to a security vulnerability with such sensitive data. That said, both major mobile platforms have solved for this problem: [iOS has its Keychain API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) while [Android provides a KeyStore API](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore). Both can be accessed using the [`react-native-secure-key-store` npm package](https://github.com/pradeep1991singh/react-native-secure-key-store#readme) :

```
yarn add react-native-secure-key-store
```

This package provides an easy-to-use key-value pattern, not entirely dissimilar to the one we used [in the last section](#default-preference).

## Local Database Usage {#sqlite-storage}

There may be times where having simple key-value storage isn't enough. Sometimes, you need the power and flexibility that a full-scale database provides. That said, not all of the data you need always requires a database to be hosted on the server. This instance is where having a local SQL database comes into play. React Native has a few different options for utilizing an on-device SQL database, but the most popular is using the [`react-native-sqlite-storage`](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) package:

```
yarn add react-native-sqlite-storage
```

This package allows you to use full SQL syntax for querying and creating.

## ORM Options {#orms}

Want the power and utility of a SQL database, but don't want to play with any of the SQL syntaxes yourself? No problem, there is a myriad of options to build on top of SQLite using React Native. One of my favorites us [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/). Useful for both TypeScript and vanilla JS usage, it provides a bunch of functionality that maps relatively directly to SQL.

Alternatively, if you're looking for something with more of a framework feel, there's [WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB). WatermelonDB is utilized with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) to provide an event-based fast-as-fusion alternative to more conventional ORMs.

# Remote Database Usage {#serverless}

While you're able to utilize [something like Fetch or Axios to make calls to your remote API for data](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network#using-fetch), you might want to utilize a serverless database to provide data to your apps. React Native's got you covered whether you want to use [MongoDB Stitch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-stitch-react-native-sdk), [Firebase's Firestore or Realtime Database](https://rnfirebase.io/), or others.

# Synchronized Database Usage {#realm}

While you're more than able to cache database calls manually, sometimes it's convenient to have your data synchronized with your backend. This convenience is one of the selling points of [Realm](https://realm.io/). Realm is an unconventional database in that it's written natively and is not SQL based. You're able to [integrate with React Native as a local database](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest#getting-started) and connect to their [Realm Sync platform](https://docs.realm.io/sync/getting-started-1/getting-a-realm-object-server-instance) to provide a simple to use synchronization between your database backend and mobile client.

> A note about RealmDB: [MongoDB acquired Realm in 2019](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/mongodb-to-acquire-open-source-mobile-database-realm-startup-that-raised-40m/). While this may seem like an unrelated note to leave here, I mention it because large-scale changes are in the immediate horizon for the platform. MongoDB is open about such. They plan on integrating the platform into a larger-scoped platform _also_ (confusingly) called [Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/realm). I mention this because if you're starting a new project, you may want to be aware of what these changes will have in store for your future. It seems like they have a lot of exciting things coming soon!

# Conclusion

As with many things in engineering, where to store data is a broad-reaching and integral question to be asking yourself while developing. I've found myself mixing many of these options for a single application, depending on the context. Each has its strengths to draw from and weaknesses to consider.

Signals are seemingly everywhere today. Among others, there's some flavor of signals in:

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html#connection-to-signals)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/)
- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createsignal)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes)
- [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/state/#usesignal)
- [And many more](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-evolution-of-signals-in-javascript-8ob)

There's even [efforts to bring signals into JavaScript itself](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals).

Given this explosion of popularity, many are left wondering:

> What even **are** signals?!

It's a good question! Let's explore signals, how they operate under-the-hood, and how we can use them in our libraries today.

# Signals Basics

In their most basic form, signals are a method of having some state and a way of subscribing to that state.

```javascript
// This is psuedo code. This API is possible, but not
// representative of any of the tools we're looking at today.
const counter = signal(0);

// This will re-run whenever `counter` updates
counter.subscribe(() => {
	console.log(counter.get());
});

// We can call it once
counter.set(1);

// Or any number of times
setInterval(() => {
	counter.set(count.get() + 1);
}, 1000);
```

There's a few ways to implement this, but here's a basic implementation of the API above:

```javascript
function signal(initialValue) {
	let value = initialValue;
	const subscribers = new Set();

	return {
		get: () => value,
		set: (newValue) => {
			value = newValue;
			subscribers.forEach((fn) => fn());
		},
		subscribe: (listener) => {
			subscribers.add(listener);
			return () => subscribers.delete(listener);
		},
	};
}
```

> You can see another basic variant of a signals implementation in [a 5 minute lightning talk I gave at ngConf 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7AuQUBmA4).

<img src="./signals_explainer.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="The signal stores values and sends updates to listeners. Then a setter can update the store using some API and the listeners recieves notifications of signal state changes"></img>

Here, we can see how a signal has:

- An initial value
- A getter to retrieve the value
- A setter to update the value and notify subscribers
- A way to subscribe to the signal

This is incredibly useful for being able to run one bit of code when your state changes, like binding the text value of a DOM node to some JavaScript state:

```html
<button id="clicker">0</button>

<script>
	const clickerBtn = document.getElementById("clicker");

	const countSignal = signal(0);

	countSignal.subscribe(() => {
		clickerBtn.innerText = countSignal.get();
	});

	clickerBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
		countSignal.set(countSignal.get() + 1);
	});

	// ...
</script>
```

<iframe data-frame-title="Basic Signals - StackBlitz" src="pfp-code:./basic-signals?template=node&embed=1&file=index.html"></iframe>

Here, we can see how a signal acts as a primitive for recreating [JavaScript Reactivity](/posts/what-is-reactivity) to sync state between the DOM and JS.

# Computed Properties

It's a regular occurance to derive state from other pieces of state in software engineering.

Take a `sum` function for example:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

const num1 = 12;
const num2 = 24;
const output = sum(a, b);
```

Having the ability to have `output` auto-calculated when `num1` or `num2` changed would be a gamechanger for derived state.

Luckily for us, we can build a basic API for derived state relatively trivially based on our signals implementation:

```javascript
function computed(fn, signals) {
	let value = fn();
	for (let signal of signals) {
		signal.subscribe(() => {
			value = fn();
		});
	}
	return {
		get: () => value,
	};
}
```

Now we can derive signals in a nicer way using `computed`:

```javascript
const num1 = signal(1);
const num2 = signal(2);
const output = computed(() => num1.get() + num2.get(), [num1, num2]);

console.log(output.get()); // 3
num1.set(3);
console.log(output.get()); // 5
```

We can even add in the ability to subscribe to the state updates of `computed`, much like a `signal`:

```javascript
function computed(fn, signals) {
	let value = fn();
	const subscribers = new Set();

	for (let signal of signals) {
		signal.subscribe(() => {
			value = fn();
			subscribers.forEach((sub) => sub());
		});
	}

	return {
		get: () => value,
		subscribe: (listener) => {
			subscribers.add(listener);
			return () => subscribers.delete(listener);
		},
	};
}
```

```javascript
const num1 = signal(1);
const num2 = signal(2);
const output = computed(() => num1.get() + num2.get(), [num1, num2]);

output.subscribe(() => {
	console.log(output.get());
});

num1.set(3); // Logs "5"
```

This `computed` method is is much like a `signal` but instead of having its own writable state, creates state by reading from the base signals:

<img src="./computed_explainer.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="Signals and computed can both be subscribed to, but only signals can be written to"></img>

With this API we can apply to our document once more for a basic adder:

```html
<label>
	<div>Number 1:</div>
	<input id="num1" type="number" value="0" />
</label>
<label>
	<div>Number 2:</div>
	<input id="num2" type="number" value="0" />
</label>
<p>The sum of these numbers is: <span id="output">0</span></p>

<script>
	const num1 = document.getElementById("num1");
	const num2 = document.getElementById("num2");
	const output = document.getElementById("output");

	const num1Signal = signal(0);
	const num2Signal = signal(0);
	const outputSignal = computed(
		() => num1Signal.get() + num2Signal.get(),
		[num1Signal, num2Signal],
	);

	num1.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
		num1Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
	});

	num2.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
		num2Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
	});

	outputSignal.subscribe(() => {
		output.innerText = outputSignal.get();
	});

	// ...
</script>
```

<iframe data-frame-title="Computed - StackBlitz" src="pfp-code:./computed?template=node&embed=1&file=index.html"></iframe>

## Computed with a Signal internally

> But wait! Aren't we already keeping track of state and a list of subscribers inside of `signal`? Can't we reuse that in `computed`?

We can indeed, astute reader! Let's simplify our usage of `computed` to have a `signal` as our primitive data storage:

```javascript
function computed(fn, signals) {
	const valueSignal = signal(fn());

	for (let signal of signals) {
		signal.subscribe(() => {
			valueSignal.set(fn());
		});
	}

	return {
		get: valueSignal.get,
		subscribe: valueSignal.subscribe,
	};
}
```

In fact, this idea that a `computed` signal is just a normal `signal` but in read-only mode is one which is critical to understanding much of the underlying optimizations for many signals implementations.

# Effects

To track a signal or computed value, you can use the `subscribe` method. But if we look at the other APIs, they're functions, not methods.

To keep our APIs consistent (and to add features later-on), let's create a way to subscribe to signals without using `subscribe` itself.

To do this, we can just wrap `subscribe` in an API not dissimilar from how `computed` looks:

```javascript
function effect(fn, signals) {
	for (let signal of signals) {
		signal.subscribe(() => {
			fn();
		});
	}
}
```

```javascript
const num1 = signal(1);
const num2 = signal(2);
const output = computed(() => num1.get() + b.get(), [num1, num2]);

effect(() => {
	console.log(output.get());
}, [output]);

num1.set(2); // "4" is logged to the console
num2.set(3); // "5" is logged to the console
```

This completes our base signals API trio:

- Signals can be subscribed to, has state, and can be written to.
- Computed values can be subscribed to and has state.
- Effects can be subscribed to.

<img src="./effects_explainer.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="Signals, computeds, and effects can all be subscribed to, signals and computed have state, and signals can be written to."></img>

With `effect` we can get rid of `subscribe`-ing manually in our previous addition sample all-together:

```javascript
const num1 = document.getElementById("num1");
const num2 = document.getElementById("num2");
const output = document.getElementById("output");

const num1Signal = signal(0);
const num2Signal = signal(0);
const outputSignal = computed(
	() => num1Signal.get() + num2Signal.get(),
	[num1Signal, num2Signal],
);

num1.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
	num1Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
});

num2.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
	num2Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
});

effect(() => {
	output.innerText = outputSignal.get();
}, [outputSignal]);
```

## Effects in Computed

Now that we've removed manual `subscribe`-ing from our usage of `signal`s, let's remove it from our internal `computed` example as well:

```javascript
function computed(fn, signals) {
	const valueSignal = signal(fn());

	effect(() => {
		valueSignal.set(fn());
	}, signals);

	return {
		get: valueSignal.get,
		subscribe: valueSignal.subscribe,
	};
}
```

Now the only place we use `.subscribe` is inside of `effect`.

> This is not often how `computed` is implemented, but simplies code for our usecase going forward.

# Auto-tracking

Our current signals API looks something like this:

```javascript
signal(init);
computed(fn, deps);
effect(fn, deps);
```

This works, but having `deps` be an explicit array brings a set of challenges and downsides:

- It's more verbose
- `computed` and `effect` s need a dependency array but `signal` does not
- It's easy to accidentally forget a signal in the deps array

What if we could eliminate the need for the array while still tracking the internal signals used inside of `computed` and `effect`?

This idea of invisibly tracking dependencies is called "Auto-tracking" and can be implemented by replacing our `subscribe` internal methods with usage of a `Listener` singleton.

```javascript
var Listener = null;

function signal(initialValue) {
	let value = initialValue;
	const subscribers = new Set();

	return {
		get: () => {
			if (Listener) {
				subscribers.add(Listener);
			}
			return value;
		},
		set: (newValue) => {
			value = newValue;
			subscribers.forEach((fn) => fn());
		},
	};
}

function computed(fn) {
	const valueSignal = signal(fn());

	effect(() => {
		valueSignal.set(fn());
	});

	return {
		get: valueSignal.get,
	};
}

function effect(fn) {
	Listener = fn;
	fn();
	Listener = null;
}
```

This works because `effect` updates the `Listener` and then the signals inside of `effect` are reading the initial value:

```javascript
effect(() => {
	// Inside of `signal.get` there's a check for `Listener`
	// which is now this function. It's then added as a subscriber
	// to `signal` which, on write, will retrigger this.
	//
	// It doesn't get added twice because the `Listener` is only set on the
	// first call of `fn`
	signal.get();
});
```

This behavior is then propagated into `computed` since it uses `effect` internally.

---

Now let's see our previous code sample with the new API:

```javascript
const num1 = document.getElementById("num1");
const num2 = document.getElementById("num2");
const output = document.getElementById("output");

const num1Signal = signal(0);
const num2Signal = signal(0);
const outputSignal = computed(() => num1Signal.get() + num2Signal.get());

num1.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
	num1Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
});

num2.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
	num2Signal.set(e.target.valueAsNumber);
});

effect(() => {
	output.innerText = outputSignal.get();
});
```

Cleaner, right?

# Glitches

Friends, I have something to admit; we have a fatal flaw in our signals implementation we've been building to this point.

Namely, it's possible to create a value that's incorrect for a temporary period of time before it's corrected.

This occurs because of how we've built out our subscriptions in a naive way, allowing one subscriber to receive a value earlier than the other dependencies are finished resolving the values.

Take the following code:

```javascript
const count = signal(0);
const evenOdd = computed(() => (count.get() % 2 ? "Odd" : "Even"));

effect(() => {
	console.log(`${count.get()} is ${evenOdd.get()}`);
});
```

<img src="./glitch_setup.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="Given the following: A signal of 'count' and a computed of 'evenOdd' based off of count. Then, an effect based off of both with the message of '{count} is {evenOdd}'"></img>

While this code is valid, our implementation lets it down. It will in fact emit `0 is even` at first, but once you update `count` you'll get `1 is even`, which is clearly incorrect.

<img src="./glitch_demo.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="TODO: The problem, however... Is that the signal updating to '1' is update the effect and the computed at the same time. Meaning that the effect will get '1' and 'Even', showing the incorrect temporary state of '1 is Even'"></img>

Now, this value eventually reconciles back to `1 is odd` after emitting the incorrect value, but this could lead to a number of problems if left as-is:

- Incorrect logging behavior
- Jumpy UIs
- Wrong data sent to the server

And more.

This rapid shift from an incorrect value to a correct value is called a "glitch".

> How do we make our signals "glitch-free"?

Well, we can do this by having the last `effect` wait for all the depended upon values to resolve before running.

<img src="./glitch_free.svg" style="border-radius: var(--corner-radius_l); background-color: var(--background_focus);" alt="The solution is an example of 'glitch-free' signals. The effect waits for all dependencies to resolve the value before calculating '1 is Odd'"></img>

---

Let's see how this glitch fixing looks like in code:

```javascript
var Listener = null;
// Track what signals are accessed in the Listener
var accessedSignals = new Set();
// Track what current signal is being written to
var writingSignal = null;

function signal(initialValue) {
	let value = initialValue;
	const subscribers = new Set();

	const obj = {
		get: () => {
			if (Listener) {
				subscribers.add(Listener);
				accessedSignals.add(obj);
			}
			return value;
		},
		set: (newValue) => {
			// A computed value should not update `writingSignal`, as its state is purely internal and should be marked as "read-only"
			const isInsideAComputed = !!obj.__trackedSignals;
			value = newValue;
			if (!isInsideAComputed) {
				writingSignal = obj;
			}
			subscribers.forEach((fn) => fn(obj));
			if (!isInsideAComputed) {
				writingSignal = null;
			}
		},
	};
	return obj;
}

function computed(fn) {
	const valueSignal = signal(fn());

	const { __trackedSignals } = effect(() => {
		valueSignal.set(fn());
	});

	// Assign the tracked signals to the value signal so it can be used in the `Listener` of the effect,
	// and avoid updating the `writingSignal` when the value signal is updated
	Object.assign(valueSignal, {
		__trackedSignals,
	});

	return {
		get: valueSignal.get,
		__trackedSignals,
	};
}

function effect(fn) {
	let trackedSignals = new Set();
	let seen = new Set();
	let relatedSignals = null;
	// Setup the listener that will be called when a signal is accessed
	Listener = (signal) => {
		// We have "seen" this signal
		seen.add(signal);

		// Check to see if we need to "see" any related signals before running the function
		// and cache the results until the next run
		if (!relatedSignals) {
			relatedSignals = new Set();
			trackedSignals.forEach((signalLike) => {
				if (signalLike.__trackedSignals?.has(writingSignal)) {
					relatedSignals.add(signal);
				} else if (signalLike === writingSignal) {
					relatedSignals.add(signalLike);
				}
			});
		}

		// Have we seen all the signals we need to? If so, run the function and cleanup
		if (seen.size === relatedSignals?.size) {
			fn();
			seen = new Set();
			relatedSignals = null;
		}
	};
	// Trigger the effect for the first time. This also starts auto-tracking and stores vars in `accessedSignals`
	fn();
	// Keep a copy of the accessed signals for reference in the `Listener` later
	trackedSignals = new Set(accessedSignals);
	// Cleanup
	Listener = null;
	accessedSignals = new Set();

	// Return the tracked signals for the effect so it can be used in the `Listener` later
	return {
		__trackedSignals: trackedSignals,
	};
}
```

Here, we're keeping track of what signal is currently writing state. We're then checking what variables are relative to the `Listener` when we run `fn` inside of our `effect`.

Finally, we cross-reference how many variables depend on the written signal and wait for that number of subscription calls are ran and only execute the `effect` when we've seen the right number of updates.

```javascript
const count = signal(0);
const evenOdd = computed(() => (count.get() % 2 ? "Odd" : "Even"));

// Notice how this effect only runs once, even though it depends
// on both `count` and `evenOdd`
effect(() => {
	alert(`${count.get()} is ${evenOdd.get()}`);
});

count.set(2);
count.set(123);
```

# Where do Signals fit in?

Before we wrap up, let's talk about where signals fit into the broader scope of the JavaScript ecosystem.

If we take a venn diagram of whether a primitive:

1. Has state
2. Can be written to
3. Can be subscribed to

It might look something like this:

!['const var' has state. 'let var' has state and can write. 'effect' can write. 'subject' can write and can subscribe. 'computed' has state and can subscribe. 'observable's can subscribe. Signals can do all.](./state_venn_diagram.svg)

> You may not be familiar with what an observable or `Subject` are. These terms [come from RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), which is a library that provides an event system in your codebase.
>
> However, we can see examples of observables in [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) when you run [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) to a `<button>`.
>
> The event target itself doesn't have permanent state but will pass a value to a subscriber when an in-transit value comes through. However, you're unable to write values to that event stream.
>
> Compare and contrast to, say, a `Subject` that extends an observable with the capabilities of being able to emit your own events. A good example of this might be emitting your own [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) on the `document` object.

Here, we can see that signals are a powerful primitive that takes ownership over multiple areas of the reactivity story.

Being the lead maintainer of TanStack Form, I wanted to make sure that we supported the then-upcoming release of React Compiler properly.

While it required us to [rethink some strategies we were relying on for internal code authoring](https://github.com/TanStack/form/pull/1035), it seemed to me that we were successful in that endeavor after some testing and user feedback.

Front-end development is all about creating the parts of a website that users see and interact with. HTML is like the skeleton, giving structure to the contentâ€”things like headings, paragraphs, and buttons. CSS is what makes everything look good, adding colors, fonts, and layouts to the mix. Then there's JavaScript, which brings it all to life by making the website interactive, like responding when you click a button or type into a form. 

Together, these tools make websites both beautiful and functional, creating a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.

In this series, you'll learn how to tackle each to build your own projects.

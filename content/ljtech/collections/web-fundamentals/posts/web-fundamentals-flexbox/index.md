# Flexbox

The CSS property `display: flex` is also known as flexbox. Adding `display: flex` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become flex items.

Flexbox is used for creating one-dimensional layouts on a column (up and down) or row (left and right) direction. To change said direction, we must change the following property:

# Using `flex-direction`

```css
flex-direction: column;
```

![A column of three items stacked on one-another](./flex-column.svg)

```css
flex-direction: row;
```

![A row of three items stacked next to one-another](./flex-row.svg)

---

# Using `flex-wrap`

This property allows you to make dynamic layouts that can respond to dimension constraints. In practice, it means you can tell a `flex` layout to wrap into a new row or column if there is not enough space available. Let's look at a simple example:

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

![Two examples of elements in a row. The second example has a smaller width, thus causing the layout to wrap into a new line](./flex-wrap.svg)

## Wrapping with `min-width`

You can also set a minimum width to elements that are set to fill the flex container.

Applying a `min-width` to a child element will automatically trigger a wrap on the outer container if that element reaches its minimum value.

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 480px;
}

.flex-child-item {
  flex-basis: 0;
  flex-grow: 1;
  min-width: 128px;
}
```

![Three different blocks with a minimum width value, automatically wrapping when they get too small.](./flex-wrap-min-width.svg)

Keep in mind that we cannot neatly fit elements into a grid this way. The last overlapping item *will* fill the entire row.

# Tip: Use `flex-flow`!

The `flex-flow` property allows us to use just one command to define both the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties!

If we wanted to set up the previous example using this property, we'd do so like this:

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

---

# Using `align-items`

This property allows you to arrange your items between the `start`, `center` or `end` of a given layout.

For the following example, the `flex-direction` has been set to row. This will become important later.

```css
align-items: center;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the middle of the container](./flex-align-items-center.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the bottom of the container](./flex-align-items-end.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the top of the container](./flex-align-items-start.svg)

> #### Important! The `start` and `end` suffixes are axis-dependent.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `row`, the start and end will point to top and bottom.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `column`, the start and end will point to left and right.

---

# Using `justify-content`

This property is used to distribute your content across the main axis of a flex layout. 

This can serve as an alignment property, or as a way to space out your content. Here are the available values.

## Start, center & end

These control the alignment from left, to center, to right. Keep in mind that the values `start` and `end` can change depending on RTL layouts.

```css
justify-content: center;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the center of the container](./flex-justify-center.svg)


```css
justify-content: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the end of the container](./flex-justify-end.svg)

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the start of the container](./flex-justify-start.svg)

## Space elements

You can also space elements using three commands: `space-around`, `space-between` and `space-evenly`.


```css
/* Each item has equal emount of space around itself,
meaning gap between items are twice the spacing value. */
justify-content: space-around;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the left and right with spacing equal the left and right](./flex-justify-space-around.svg)

```css
/* Space items so that they fill
the entire size of the container. */
justify-content: space-between;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the furthest left and right](./flex-justify-space-between.svg)

```css
/* Make it so the space between the edges and
the gaps between elements are equal. */
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

![Three items in a container with equal spacing on all sides](./flex-justify-space-evenly.svg)

# `Grow`, `shrink` and `basis`

With flexbox, you'll find these three properties that are rarely used, but help us define how elements change size based on their container and their sibling elements.

As a baseline, `grow` defines how items take up empty space, `shrink` defines how items that overflow can decrease in size to properly fill the available space, and `basis` defines the initial size of a flex item.

Let's look at them more closely.

## Using `flex-grow`

This property defines how empty space is distributed among the objects inside a flex container.

Say you have three items, one each with a number inside. They contain their own padding, but apart from that, have nothing else applied.

You'll be met with this flex layout:

![Three blocks with the same dimensions, centered in a flex container.](./flex-grow-initial.svg)

But now let's distribute these items so that we have a 3x1 grid instead of a pack of boxes. To do that, we will apply the following code to the `.box` class.

```css
.box {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

![The three blocks evenly stretched to fit the container.](./flex-grow-three-columns.svg)

This works out perfectly! But what if we wanted to change the contents? For the sake of demonstration, let's change each label and make their lengths very different.

![With different sized labels, the items are no longer taking equal amounts of space in the container.](./flex-grow-new-label.svg)

Now the items are no longer distributed properly... But why?

<br>

### How grow works

This has to do with how `flex-grow` works in tandem with an object's initial size.

In our first example, all of our labels had the same width, and thus, all of our objects had the same size.
<br>

![A visual explanation of how element sizes are being calculated with padding.](./flex-grow-bts.svg)
<br>
This is because the `flex-grow` property *distributes the space* that's available around the elements.

This means that, if the starting size of an element is bigger than another, they will continue to be larger when `flex-grow: 1` is set!

![A visual representation of the space available inside the container.](./flex-grow-space-available.svg)


![The three elements are now bigger thanks to the extra space, evenly distributed among them.](./flex-grow-space-distributed.svg)
<br>

> **The value used for the property determines the percentage of the available space that a particular item will take.**

We can see this in action by dividing the space unevenly to see how it'll behave:
<br><br>
![The three elements all hav different grow values, thus having an uneven distribution.](./flex-grow-uneven.svg)
<br><br>
And if the growth value does not add up to 1, we can expect there to be empty spaces in our flex layout, as in the following example:
<br><br>
![Three grow values that do not add to 1, thus leaving empty space.](./flex-grow-incomplete.svg)
<br><br>

#### How do we solve our original problem?

For that, we need to move onto the next property, which helps us set the initial size of an element.

---

## Using `flex-basis`

The basis property lets us define the initial size of an element. This can be any numerical value, but also some special property values as well.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `flex-basis: auto` | This is the default value. It will by default attempt to take either the width or height of the element, depending on the `flex-direction`. If those dimensions are unset, it defaults to `fit-content`. |
| `flex-basis: fit-content` | As the name suggests, it sets the initial dimension as the content's dimensions on the appropriate axis. |
| `flex-basis: min-content` | Sets the initial value as the minimum possible dimension. This means squishing the flex layout until it can no longer be shrunk. |
| `flex-basis: 0` | Sets the initial value of the element to zero. Visually, however, that doesn't actually happen. It reaches `min-content` and stops. |

Here are different examples of how `flex-basis` works with different values.

![An example of an element filling the available space with a flex-basis value of 100%.](./flex-basis-example-one.svg)

![All three elements now have different flex-basis values. Auto, zero and 320px, respectively.](./flex-basis-example-two.svg)
<br>

### Applying our solution

To distribute flex items evenly, we must set two properties to all child elements of the flex container.

```css
.box {
  /* Distribute the available
  space evenly among elements */
  flex-grow: 1;

  /* Set the initial value of
  all elements to zero. */
  flex-basis: 0;
}
```

While visually, `flex-basis: 0` sets the minimum dimensions to `min-content`, it actually does set the initial value to `0` behind the scenes.

This means that, when we apply `flex-grow: 1` to all elements, their initial size will be null, and the space of the entire container will be shared evenly. 

![With the properties applied, the size of each element is now equal again.](./flex-grow-basis-zero.svg)

# When to use flexbox?

- Used in headers, lists, tags, or any other block or inline content with the appropriate `flex-direction`;
- Primary method to align and justify content in small components;

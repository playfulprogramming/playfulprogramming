It's been some time since I started my extra-work FREE mentoring path through the Mentorcruise platform. I decided to follow the willing students who aspire to master web development and give them the right way.

I must say that it is a big commitment, but what drives me to continue my tutoring path with passion?

## Advantages

I continue because during this experience I have helped a lot with my advice, but in turn, I have been rewarded in different ways.

#### Awareness

First of all, awareness, having as the goal to explain techniques and concepts in an easy and intuitive way, inevitably one is led to deepening the subject very well.

#### Empathy

Another aspect where I have improved a lot is empathy with people. Knowing how to relate as an authoritarian figure, but at the same time a friend is certainly something I had to improve on. The ability to dictate study rhythms to one's students is also something I have learned over time and which I must say was not easy to master.

#### English

Mostly my lessons were in English. The knowledge of the subject matter and the patience of the students allowed me to grow a lot in the dialectic and in trying to be more fluent in a language that is not mine.
This result has allowed me to be able to talk at international conferences with more confidence and speak with developers from all over the world.

## Final thought

Even if this type of activity is very demanding and requires seriousness and a huge commitment, I decided to continue with my second year of tutoring because this activity has a lot of advantages.

If you have never thought about trying this kind of experience, try to explain something to your colleagues to understand if it's something you like.
